That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Oh. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Marty, are you alright? Because, you might regret it later in life.

Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. That's right. About 30 years, it's a nice round number.

You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Alright, punk, now- Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Ohh, no.
