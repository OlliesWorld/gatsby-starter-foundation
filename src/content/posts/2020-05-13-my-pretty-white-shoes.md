Yeah, exactly. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.
